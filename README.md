# ðŸ©º Health Activity Dashboard

This dashboard analyzes daily steps, calorie intake, and health metrics using Preswald.

Please preview the code in hello.py, when I was trying to publish the code, there was an internal server error but my preview was working. For this reason, I decided to deploy the app and its contents on this github page.
